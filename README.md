# Demo-Job-board
Android Application
This android application has been created to demonstrate a demo app for listing jobs with their connected businesses.
The structure of the app consists of three main folders: Adapters, Fragments and Model, with two separate Classes, MainActivity and ParseJson. It has two different tab layouts and these tab layouts can be found under the java/Fragments folder. When the app starts, it loads the two tab layouts as Fragments, then it gets the jobs list by reading the JSON file and parses it, and then it starts creating the job list in each job Fragment by adding the jobs with their details. It also uses Adapters and GridView to show the details and businesses inside each job.
